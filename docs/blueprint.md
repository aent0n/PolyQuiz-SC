## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon orange (#FF4500) to capture the futuristic and vibrant style of Star Citizen, inspired by the original's vibrant highlights.
- Background color: Dark cosmic blue (#1A237E) as a backdrop, reminiscent of deep space, echoing the deep blues of the original's background.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#8E2DE2), to give contrast while remaining within the analogous colors of neon orange and dark cosmic blue, similar to the original's use of contrasting button colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Orbitron', a sans-serif, to provide a computerized, techy look, mirroring the clear, modern font used in the original.
- Sleek, vector-based icons that align with Star Citizen's UI style, such as ship icons, currency symbols (UEC), and mission markers, maintaining a consistent visual language with the game.
- Futuristic UI with a clean, modular layout and distinct panels for the host dashboard, player lobbies, question display, and leaderboard, adopting a similar panel-based structure as seen in the original.
- Subtle animations, like crossfades and slides, during transitions between quiz stages, adding a touch of dynamism akin to the original's polished presentation.
